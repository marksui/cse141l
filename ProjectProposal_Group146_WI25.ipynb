    "## 3. BACKGROUND  \n",
    "Financial markets are constantly evolving, and identifying the overall market state is essential for investors and institutions. Traditionally, market conditions have been assessed subjectively through news sentiment, economic reports, and price charts. However, with the increasing availability of data, **quantitative approaches** have gained prominence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key concepts in prior research:  \n",
    "#### 1. Market Volatility as a Risk Indicator  \n",
    "- The **VIX Index (CBOE Volatility Index)** is widely used as a measure of market fear and uncertainty. Higher VIX values are historically associated with bear markets and economic downturns (**Whaley, 2000**).  \n",
    "- Research shows that **market volatility often spikes before major market corrections** (**Giot, 2005**).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Market Regimes and State Classification  \n",
    "- Financial markets tend to alternate between distinct phases: **bullish (growth), bearish (decline), and neutral (sideways trading)**.  \n",
    "- Some studies use **Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and clustering methods** to identify these regimes (**Ang & Timmermann, 2012**).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Simple Market Trend Indicators  \n",
    "- **Moving averages (50-day and 200-day)** have historically been used to indicate trends (**Fama & French, 1988**).  \n",
    "- **Momentum-based indicators** like MACD and RSI have been used in previous works to study market movement (**Jegadeesh & Titman, 1993**).\n",
